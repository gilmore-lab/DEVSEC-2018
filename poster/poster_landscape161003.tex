    \par Despite an increasing push from publishers and funders toward more open scientific practices, reproducibility and transparency are hindered by the low rate at which researchers share their data and procedures. In two recent surveys, only 28.1\% of respondents (N = 83) reported sharing data with other researchers, although 50.0\% of them used an online video sharing service to view other researchers' data and 46.9\% used the same online platform to locate video clips for teaching or conference presentations. The field seems to be moving in the right direction, however, 68.8\% of the same researchers had applied for permission from their ethics board to share their data with other researchers. We discuss the challenges, and some potential solutions, to move researchers closer to open sharing of data and procedures, including: 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item ensuring participant confidentiality and addressing privacy concerns;
        \vspace{-.5em}
        \item meeting the requirements of institutional review boards;
        \vspace{-.5em}
        \item fostering collaboration among international researchers with different institutional frameworks; and 
        \vspace{-.5em}
        \item facilitating data management and links with online repositories. 
    \end{enumerate}
    Databrary and Datavyu are among the tools that developmental scientists can use to share data and materials. Widespread sharing will accelerate discovery.
